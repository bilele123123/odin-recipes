        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Into a large pot that holds at least 10 quarts of water, add all of the beef bones and cover it with water. 
                Bring to a boil and scoop out all impurities and foam. Do this for about 5 minutes then take out the bones and drain the water. 
                Clean the bones afterwards. After that, add the bones back into the pot, and cover it with 6 quarts of water.</li>
            <li>Char the onions and ginger over fire, or toast the onion and ginger until charred or browned on all sides.</li>
            <li>Toast all of your spices; cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves, and black cardamon pod until fragrant.
                Place them inside an herb bag or cheesecloth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot with the bones to a boil and bring the heat down into a simmer. Add the charred onions, ginger and the spices.
                Add 1 tablespoon of salt, 1/2 of fish sauce, and the rock sugar. Simmer the broth for at least 3 hours, and remember to remove impurities.
                If you cleaned the bones correctly, there shouldn't be much impurities or little to none.</li>
            <li>After simmering the broth for at least 3 hours, remove the onions, ginger, and spices. Then strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer 
                into another pot.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Bring the broth to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook your rice noodles until soft, then strain it dry</li>
            <li>Place your rice noodle servings into a bowl, and pour the beef broth into the bowl, as much as you like.</li>
